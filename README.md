Tool to interact with the Bluetooth peripherals on Windows



Bluetooth command line tools are a suite of command line utilities for Microsoft Windows that can be used to configure your bluetooth adapter, discover remote bluetooth devices and services, transfer files to OBEX capable devices.

All utilities can be invoked as a part of a batch script or other automated background process or launched manually from the Windows command prompt.

Currently there are seven utilities in the suite:

    btinfo

        Displays information about installed bluetooth adapter. Output format can be customized. (More info and btinfo usage examples...)

    btconfig

        Modifies friendly name and class-of-device (desktop, laptop, server) of the local bluetooth radio. Turns discovery on or off. Ebables or disables incoming bluetooth connections. (More info and btconfig usage examples...)
